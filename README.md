# Number Guessing Game

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a fun and interactive number guessing game in Python.  
The Player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range and has a limited number of tries.  
The game includes levels that increase the number range, making it harder and harder with every level.

## Solution
This game is implemented in Python using:
- **random** module for generating numbers
- **while loops** to manage gameplay
- **input validation** to handle user inputs safely
- **level system** that increases difficulty
- **try count** that limits the number of guesses per round
